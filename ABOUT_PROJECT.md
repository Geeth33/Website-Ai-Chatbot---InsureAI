# About This Project - InsureAI Lanka

InsureAI Lanka is a high-end, AI-powered vehicle and life insurance landing page designed specifically for the Sri Lankan market. It combines cutting-edge AI integration with a premium, luxury aesthetic to redefine how users interact with insurance services.

## 🌟 The Vision
The project focuses on **speed, trust, and intelligence**. By leveraging AI to provide instant quotes and 7-second claims processing, InsureAI offers a "future-proof" experience that eliminates the traditional bureaucracy of insurance.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Ultra-Fast AI Assistant
- **Real AI Intelligence**: Powered by **Groq AI (Llama 3)** for sub-second, intelligent responses.
- **Context-Aware**: The assistant understands the company's specific insurance packages, local presence in Sri Lanka, and procedural details.
- **Dynamic Visibility**: Smart-scroll logic that hides the AI widget at the bottom of the page to ensure developer credits are never obstructed.

### 2. Premium Experience & Design
- **Cinematic Start**: A modern animated intro sequence that sets a professional tone upon arrival.
- **Compact Glassmorphism**: A "floating pill" header that transitions smoothly on scroll, maintaining perfect transparency over the hero section.
- **Background Dynamics**: Blurred liquid orbs and drifting glass elements that add depth and a "3D" feel to the interface.

### 3. Integrated Services
- **Vehicle & Life Insurance**: A unified platform with a category switcher for different insurance types.
- **Interactive Calculator**: Real-time premium estimation using an intuitive slider on the packages page.
- **Visualized Stepper**: A clear 4-step process showing the speed of AI-driven claims.
